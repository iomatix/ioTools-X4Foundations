# ioTools - WebTool

This repository contains a simple WebApp tool designed initially for browsing documentation on MD and AI scripting. Additional features will be added in the future based on personal or community feedback.

## How to Use

1. **Setup:**
   - Extract the WebTool into the main folder of your unpacked game files.

   If you are using my XRCatTool scripts to unpack game data, you can copy all contents from the WebTool folder into the "_unpacked" directory created by the `xrcattool_unpack_01_09.bat` script.

2. **Running the WebApp:**
   - Execute `_run_web.bat` and provide the desired port number (default is 8080).
   - The WebApp will start on the specified port. You can open a browser window by holding down the CTRL key and left-clicking on the generated addresses in the console output.

3. **Accessing the WebApp:**
   - Navigate to the provided URL in your web browser to use the tool.
